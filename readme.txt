    == Frequently Asked Questions ==
    = How can I add Poll to a blog post or page? = Just add the shortcode **[powr-poll label='MY LABEL']** (including the brackets) in your post where you'd like your Poll to appear. Then visit your page!

    = How can I add  Poll to my site multiple times? = Just be sure to specify different label text, eg **[powr-poll label='MY LABEL 1']**, **[powr-poll label='MY LABEL 2']** for each time you use the plugin

    = Why do you require me to sign up? = Signing up is what allows us to track which plugins are yours, and allows you to edit them right in your page.

    = Will my users see the settings icon in the corner of the Poll? = No! You only see the settings icon because you own the plugins. To temporarily hide it, click on your page and then type 'p + down arrow' (the letter p followed by the down arrow). You can show the icon again by typing 'p + up-arrow'.

    = I can't see the settings icon anymore, what happened? = You are just logged out of POWr.io. You can show the icon again by typing 'p + up-arrow'.

    = Is POWr Poll Free? = Yes, the basic version of Poll is completely free!

    = Why should I upgrade? = Upgrading removes all POWr watermarks, speeds up widget loading speed, gets you premium support, and most importantly supports the creation of more great plugins!
